## module-extended_client_fields

The Extended Client Fields module lets you construct any number of form fields to store additional information for your client accounts. The module comes with a number of nifty features, including:

* Control whether the fields appear in the Edit Client -> Main tab or -> Settings tab.
* Control the location and order they appear in the pages.
*  Choose whether the field should only appear for the administrator, or the client as well.
*  Each field can be of any of the following field types: textbox, textarea, select or multi-select dropdown, radio buttons or checkboxes.
* You can define a default value for the fields.
* Group related field under a section header (optional)
